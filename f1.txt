What Are Some Unknown Benefits Of Doing Namaz Or Salat?Â 
Dalai Lama once said, "Calm mind brings inner strength and self-confidence, so that's very important for good health."

Do you know our everyday doings mark a serious impact on our health?

Yes, they do, and that is why our ingenious ancestors had forged some iron-fisted activities to our daily schedule.

Apart from religious factor, our ancestors had realized different benefits of doing Namaz.

They had considered it as one of the best ways of focusing on health and mind.

Start churning through the story.

There is a ritual that you have to wash your hands and feet before going for Namaz.

People prefer to do Namaz five times a day, certainly wiping off germs and bacteria every time they put their feet and hands under the tap.

The standing posture of Namaz is called Qiyam, which regulates the blood in the lower body portion.

This also helps in maintaining the strength of the muscles, especially of the legs.

We all know how Yoga is important for our body and mind.

The postures people make while doing Namaz somehow connect with the postures made in some Yoga Asanas.
